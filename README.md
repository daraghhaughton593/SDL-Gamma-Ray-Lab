# SDL-Gamma-Ray-Lab
SDL Gamma Ray Lab for Caimin, Dominic, Liam and Daragh

For Calibration routine:

i) use data from initial test runs
ii) Pick most important peak, based on largest emission fraction for each source (maybe as a function arg, for modularity?)
iii) fit gaussian to specified peak:
      - def Gau1(data, a, b, c, h):
          return (a * np.exp(-(data - b)**2 / (2 * c**2))) + h

iv) extract channel value for peak centre from fit params (b in above code)
